# University Management System Project Overview

The University Management System Project is a simplified version of a real-world university 
management system (UMS). Its primary objective is to provide a comprehensive platform for 
managing data related to subjects, teachers, students, and other crucial aspects of a 
university environment. The project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of the Spring 
framework and its specifications.

## Key Features and Functionality
The University Management System offers the following key features:
1. **Student Management**: Students can see the subjects they are enrolled, grades on subject, 
teacher information, teachers tutoring sessions and also write to forum on subject
and create bug tickets to staff members.
2. **Teacher Management**: Teachers can see their subjects, create assignments, create tutor sessions, 
create forums and ask for classes on tickets.
3. **Expandability**: The project's architecture is designed to be scalable and extendable. 
Users can further develop the application by incorporating additional features and 
functionalities as per their requirements.
4. **Tests**: The project also provides some test cases.

## Data Preparation
As the project assumes a higher entity or domain responsible for data management, users 
need to insert initial data into the database to ensure proper functionality. [The Data 
Preparation Guide](DATAPREP.md) provides instructions and scripts to assist with this process.

## Technologies Used
The University Management System is built using the Spring framework and its specifications. 
It leverages **Spring Boot** for rapid application development, 
and **Spring Data JPA** for database access.
