# University Management System Project Overview

The University Management System Project is a simplified version of a real-world university 
management system (UMS). Its primary objective is to provide a comprehensive platform for 
managing data related to subjects, teachers, students, and other crucial aspects of a 
university environment. The project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of the Spring 
framework and its specifications.

## Key Features and Functionality

The University Management System offers the following key features:
1. **User Management**: The system provides a way to autenticate and authorizate different kind of users
based on their role.
2. **Student Management**: Students can see the subjects they are enrolled, grades on subject, 
teacher information, teachers tutoring sessions and also write to forum on subject
and create bug tickets to staff members.
3. **Teacher Management**: Teachers can see their subjects, create assignments, create tutor sessions, 
create forums and ask for classes on tickets.
4. **Authentication and Authorization**: The project implements a secure authentication mechanism 
to control access to sensitive data, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions.
5. **Expandability**: The project's architecture is designed to be scalable and extendable. 
Users can further develop the application by incorporating additional features and 
functionalities as per their requirements.
6. **Rest API**: To support integrations with other systems or services, the project 
provides a well-documented and user-friendly REST API. This enables 
developers to interact with the application programmatically.
7. **Tests**: The project also provides some test cases.

## Installation and Setup
To install and set up the University Management System locally, follow the steps outlined in 
the [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md).

## Data Preparation
As the project assumes a higher entity or domain responsible for data management, users 
need to insert initial data into the database to ensure proper functionality. [The Data 
Preparation Guide](DATAPREP.md) provides instructions and scripts to assist with this process.

## Future Scope and Extensions
While the project serves as a learning exercise, there is ample scope for expansion and improvement. 
Users are encouraged to explore and enhance the system by:

* Implementing additional features such as course scheduling, 
student performance analytics, and fee management.
* Enhancing the user interface to improve the overall user experience.
* Integrating with external systems or services to extend the system's capabilities.

## Technologies Used
The University Management System is built using the Spring framework and its specifications. 
It leverages **Spring Boot** for rapid application development, **Spring Security** for authentication and authorization, 
and **Spring Data JPA** for database access.
